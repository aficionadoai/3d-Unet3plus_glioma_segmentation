# 3d-Unet3plus_glioma_segmentation
glioma segmentation of multi-model MRI scans
3D Unet+++ biomedical segmentation model for glioma segmentation.
The main codes are borrowed from https://github.com/tkuanlun350/3DUnet-Tensorflow-Brats18. I modified the network model from 3d u-net to 3d u-net+++ by adding interconnections between encode and decoder as well as intraconnections between decoders.
